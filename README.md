### Projects
Here are a few of my projects that showcase my skills:

1. **Titanic Data Analysis**:This project involves data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using the publicly available Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore the dataset to uncover key insights about the passengers and their survival rates.
2. **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Air Passenger Dataset**:This project involves performing time series analysis and forecasting on the Air Passenger dataset. The main objectives are to preprocess the data, visualize the time series, decompose the time series into its components, and build a SARIMA model to forecast future values.
3. **Project Name 3**: Brief description of what the project does and what technologies were used.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see more of my work!
